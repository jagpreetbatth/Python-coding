# Python-coding

Quick points:

* Data analysis to study methods that will help to increase ROI for an online shopping website called "InstaCart" using Python language, Anaconda and Jupyter.

* Exploratory data analysis of customer shopping trends, inventory control and outlook to maximize invested potential and plan for future needs.

## About Instacart Data Analysis Project

Instacart, an existing online grocery platform, requests the use of exploratory data analysis of collected sales and inventory data to derive insights and implementing future strategies to maximize profits and control inventory. In the analysis, customer purchasing trends need to be identified in order to implement targeted marketing efforts. Make a collaborated effort to maximize the potential of key performance indices utilizing the insight gained from this project data analysis to aid in a successful marketing campaign.  

**NOTE:** *Instacart is a non-fictional company with open source data available online. A fictional project brief has been made in order to show case potential questions and problems any online platform may have.*

## Key Questions
The Instacart marketing and sales teams have asked a series of business related questions. Here are the main questions they’d like answered:

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

## Data Background
Orders, products, departments and customer data used in the project was attained from Career Foundry data analytics database which further attained their data from an open-source database available from the Instacart company website. To preserve privacy of actual customers, a fictional customer database was created and utilized in data analysis for project completion and to reflect true to actual service analysis. A full breakdown of each dataset can be found below.

## Program library Background
The following python libraries were used:

- Pandas, NumPy: For Data Analysis
- Seaborn: For Visualization

## Code Execution Background
Code utilized in Jupyter notebook format (Viewable "Scripts" Folder)

Directions to run code:
* open terminal
* run the command:
- Importing data: `jupyter notebook importData.ipynb`
- Generate CrossTabs: `jupyter notebook createCrossTabs.ipynb`
