# Python-coding

Quick points:

* Data analysis to study methods to increase ROI for an online shopping website called "InstaCart" using Python, Anaconda and Jupyter.

* Exploratory data analyis of customer shopping trends, inventory control and outlook to maximize invested potential and plan for future needs.

About Instacart Data Analysis Project

## About
For this project, Instacart is a fictional online grocery company that has hired me as a data analyst. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria utilizing python. They want me to look into customer purchasing habits and identify common trends to start a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether these campaigns have an effect on the sale of their products.

**Note:** *Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement.*

## Key Questions
The Instacart marketing and sales teams have asked a series of business related questions. Here are the main questions they’d like answered:

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

## About The Data
The data was provided by my data analytics course, **Career Foundry**. The data is a combination of multiple open-source data sets from Instacart. A customer data set was created and included for the purpose of this project and does not reflect the actual Instacart company. It is only intended to answer the project's key questions. A full breakdown of each dataset can be found below.

- Orders Data
- Products Data
- Departments Data
- Customer Data

## Tools
For this project, the following python libraries were used:

- Pandas: For Data Analysis
- Seaborn: For Visualization

## Executing The Code
The code is available as a jupyter notebook, available under /03 Scripts/.
To launch the notebook, open terminal and run the command:
- Importing data: `jupyter notebook importData.ipynb`
- Generate CrossTabs: `jupyter notebook createCrossTabs.ipynb`
